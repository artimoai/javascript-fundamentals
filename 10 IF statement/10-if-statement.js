/* 
    Conditional (ternary) operator

    The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator
    that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), 
    then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy
    followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute
    if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as 
    an alternative to an if...else statement.
